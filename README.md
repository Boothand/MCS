# MCS (Melee Combat System)
Unreal Engine 4 Melee Combat Project

This is an open source project.  Created by and for JK fans in an attempt to re-create the multiplayer melee combat in the Jedi Knight
series of games using a modern game engine.  Anyone may contribute in any way they can.

The main goal of this project is to create a full featured multiplayer (dedicated server) melee combat game using Unreal Engine 4.
